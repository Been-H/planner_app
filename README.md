# planner_app
This is a project I started over spring break 2021. It is a planner app geared towards students and is class/assignment oriented. I plan to continue working on this in the future.

I will be hosting it on Heroku soon for anyone to use

Here are some features I will be implementing in the future:

-better mobile responsitivity for class view
- ordering assingments in a class in order of important and urgency
  (Each class has a due date and I will add an estimated time to complete. The longer and closer an assignment is, the more urgent it is therefore it will be at the    top of your list)
- Text message notifications for your reminder? Not sure whether there is an API or library to do this but if there is that would be really cool and helpful
- Global reminders on dash board along with being specific to each class
